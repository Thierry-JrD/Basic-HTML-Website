## Structure

The website structure consists of the following sections:
- A **Top Page** with navigation and a hero section.
- A **Middle Page** that contains project details, work experience, open-source contributions, and education.
- A **Reviews** section to showcase testimonials.
- A **Footer** with copyright information.

## HTML Overview

The HTML code is divided into semantic sections for clarity and structure:
- `<header>`: Contains the navigation menu and logo.
- `<section>`: Encapsulates distinct parts of the content, including the hero, projects, work experience, open source contributions, education, and reviews.

## CSS Overview

### Global Styles
- The `*` selector is used to reset margin, padding, and box-sizing to ensure consistent styling across browsers.
- The `body` is flex-centered, with a margin to keep the content visually appealing.
- The primary font used is `"Comic Sans MS"`, giving the site a playful and informal look.

### Layout & Design
- The container div (`#container`) is styled to be 70% of the screen width with a solid border.
- Flexbox and CSS Grid are used to layout elements like the navigation bar and content blocks.
- A simple grid layout is applied to the middle page using `grid-template-columns` for a responsive design.

## Navigation

The navigation links allow users to navigate between different sections of the site:
- **Home**
- **Projects**
- **Articles**
- **Contacts**

Each of these links uses the `<a>` tag with a hover effect that changes the link color.

## Sections

### Top Page

This section consists of:
- A header with the **logo** and **navigation** bar.
- A **hero section** with a main title (`<h1>`) and a description (`<p>`).

```html
